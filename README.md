# Blog Web Application

This web application was created as a final project for Generations UK Tech Talent Accelerator Programme (tta-lon6)

HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React was used on the front-end for responsive design.

Google's Firebase was used as the backend.

The project contains user authentication, via Firebase's API.

Once signed in, the user is able to create and upload a post to the Firebase database.

The posts are then available for viewing on the web application.
